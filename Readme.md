# Rover-Soft

Software for the rover project. Written in Python 3.

To run this you need to install packages: `Pluginable`, `Tki-Wrapper` and `Cis-Protocol`. Those packages were written by me and are available on my [Github profile](https://github.com/Jakub21). Program also requires some packages that are available on PIP. Those can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Program variant itended for rover is started by `launch.py` and program for remote controller with `control.py`.
